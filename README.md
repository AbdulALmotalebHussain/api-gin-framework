# Album Management Service

This project implements a simple RESTful service using the [Gin Web Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) in Go. It provides endpoints for managing a collection of music albums, including operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete albums.

## Features

- List all albums
- Retrieve a single album by its ID
- Add a new album
- Update an existing album by its ID
- Delete an album by its ID

## Getting Started
