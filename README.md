# api-gin-framework

// Package album is a basic RESTful API that stores and retrieves album data
+// based on ID values.
+//
+// This API is built using the Gin framework, which is a popular and powerful
+// web framework for Go. It provides a flexible way to handle HTTP requests
+// and responses, and includes a router that makes it easy to define routes
+// and handlers.
+//
+// The API includes GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for retrieving, adding,
+// updating, and deleting albums respectively. The API also includes a GET
+// route for retrieving all albums.
+//
+// The API is built using a map for the album data. When an album is added,
+// updated, or deleted, the corresponding change is made to the map. The map
+// is used to retrieve albums based on their ID values.
+//
+// The API uses JSON to encode and decode album data. The API includes a
+// middleware function that formats JSON responses in a human-readable way.
